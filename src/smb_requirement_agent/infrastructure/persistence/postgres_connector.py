"""Where PostgreSQL adapters obtain connections.

Long-running processes (the API and its workers) share one bounded, health-checked
pool so each unit of work reuses an established session instead of paying a new
TCP/TLS/authentication handshake. One-shot commands (migrations, backfills,
projection rebuilds) open a single direct connection per use and need no pool.
Both hand out connections with the same transaction semantics, so adapters are
unaware which one they were given.
